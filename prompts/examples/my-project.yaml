  Build a sophisticated multi-agent AI system that:
  - Coordinates multiple autonomous AI agents
  - Triggers and manages GitHub Actions workflows
  - Automates deployment and testing pipelines
  - Handles general coding tasks and refactoring
  - Monitors repository health and code quality
  - Integrates with GitHub APIs for full automation
  
  ## Core Components
  
  ### 1. Agent Orchestrator
  - Central coordination hub for all AI agents
  - Task queue and assignment system
  - Inter-agent communication protocol
  - State synchronization and persistence
  
  ### 2. GitHub Integration Layer
  - Repository management (create, update, delete)
  - Branch and tag operations
  - Pull request automation
  - Issue tracking and resolution
  - Release management
  
  ### 3. Workflow Engine
  - GitHub Actions workflow generation
  - CI/CD pipeline automation
  - Testing and quality gate integration
  - Deployment orchestration
  
  ### 4. Code Quality Module
  - Automated code generation
  - Testing framework setup
  - Security scanning integration
  - Performance monitoring
  - Documentation generation
  
  ### 5. Monitoring & Analytics
  - System health monitoring
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Error tracking and alerting
  - Usage analytics and reporting
  
  ## Technical Requirements
  
  ### Architecture
  - Microservices architecture for scalability
  - Event-driven communication
  - API-first design with comprehensive documentation
  - Containerized deployment support
  
  ### Security
  - OAuth2 and JWT authentication
  - Role-based access control
  - Encryption for sensitive data
  - Audit logging and compliance
  
  ### Performance
  - Horizontal and vertical scaling
  - Multi-level caching strategy
  - Database optimization
  - CDN integration
  
  ### Integration Points
  - GitHub API (full feature support)
  - Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - Monitoring services (DataDog, New Relic)
  - Communication tools (Slack, Discord)
  
  ## Success Criteria
  - 10x faster project initialization
  - 90% reduction in boilerplate code
  - 80%+ automated test coverage
  - Zero configuration deployment
  - 99.9% uptime availability
  
  Build this as a production-ready, enterprise-grade system with proper logging, monitoring, testing, and comprehensive documentation.
